# Design — open-cursor documentation

A locked design system for the documentation app. Extend this file when the
system needs to grow; do not pick a new theme per page.

## Genre

Modern-minimal, in a technical documentation register.

## Macrostructure family

- Documentation home: Index-First. The page opens with a short identity block
  and makes the page groups the primary content.
- Application shell: Workbench-informed. Persistent navigation, search, page
  tools, and the table of contents behave like an instrument panel.
- Content pages: Long Document. One readable column, direct section heads,
  inline code, tables, and restrained page tools.

## Theme

- `--color-paper` `oklch(17.5% 0.025 279)`
- `--color-paper-2` `oklch(21.5% 0.03 279)`
- `--color-paper-3` `oklch(26.4% 0.0374 279.11)`
- `--color-ink` `oklch(97.4% 0.0158 196.9)`
- `--color-ink-2` `oklch(77.57% 0.0552 274.6)`
- `--color-rule` `oklch(34% 0.045 275)`
- `--color-accent` `oklch(85.61% 0.1934 156.24)`
- `--color-signal` `oklch(79.48% 0.1427 218.32)`
- `--color-focus` `oklch(87% 0.2 156.24)`

Green is the active and focus signal. Cyan is reserved for links and compact
identity geometry. Neither colour fills large surfaces.

## Typography

- Display: IBM Plex Sans Variable, weight 700, normal.
- Body: IBM Plex Sans Variable, weight 400.
- Mono: Fira Code, weights 400–600.
- Display tracking: `-0.025em`.
- Type scale anchor: `--text-display = clamp(2rem, 6vw, 4rem)`.

## Spacing

The 4-point named scale lives in `app/tokens.css`. Page and component rules use
named tokens rather than raw spacing values.

## Motion

- Easing: `--ease-out`, an exponential ease-out curve.
- Reveal pattern: none. Documentation is present immediately.
- Reduced motion: remove transforms and transitions.

## Microinteractions stance

- Focus appears instantly.
- Hover is a colour or surface shift, only on hover-capable pointers.
- Pressed controls move down by one pixel.
- Silent success. No decorative toasts or bounce.
- Every touch-reachable control has a 44 px hit area.

## CTA voice

- Primary action: typographic link with a short underline and one-line label.
- Secondary action: quiet bordered control with a 6 px radius.

## Per-page allowances

- The documentation home uses the large geometric `OPEN-CURSOR` wordmark at
  desktop widths and the compact OCC mark with a plain-text `open-cursor`
  identity on mobile.
- The app shell uses no decorative enrichment.
- Content pages use typography and semantic data structures only.

## What pages must share

- The large geometric `OPEN-CURSOR` wordmark, compact OCC mark, and plain-text
  `open-cursor` name.
- The green and cyan signal roles.
- IBM Plex Sans and Fira Code.
- The same control geometry and focus treatment.
- The desktop search stays centred on the visible page. The large wordmark
  centres in the unobstructed docs canvas, then centres on the full page once
  the viewport is wide enough to clear the persistent sidebar.
- Stacked section headings without slash ornaments, decorative eyebrows, or
  hanging chapter labels.

## What pages may differ on

- The home is an index; articles are long documents.
- Dense reference pages may replace wide tables with labelled mobile records.
- Architecture pages may use plain-text diagrams inside the normal prose
  measure.
